# Portfolio

## Description
I have created myself a portfolio with information on me, my work and ways to contact me.

By doing this it allows for any potential employers to see my work and what I have achieved and assess whether I am a good candidate for an opening position.

This has personally allowed me to touch up on my CSS and HTML skills to further my knowledge in Web Development.

## Credits
I have used alot of other sites to allow me to gain further knowledge into CSS these include:
